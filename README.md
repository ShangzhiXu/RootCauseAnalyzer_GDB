### README for `break_script.py`

**Description:** `break_script.py` is a sophisticated Python script for automated debugging using GDB. It sets breakpoints, captures function calls, and gathers detailed debugging information, saving these details to JSON files. This script is ideal for complex debugging scenarios and automated testing environments.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- GDB with Python scripting support
- Python libraries: `subprocess`, `sys`, `time`, `gdb`, `re`, `json`, `argparse`, `logging`, `threading`

**Input Files:**

- `input.json`: Contains the configuration for breakpoints and functions to be tracked during the debugging session.
- `config.json`: configure information
- `input.txt`: stdin program that will input to your target program

**Output Files:**

- `output.json`: Captures the states and values at each breakpoint as defined in the debugging session.

**Setup:**

1. Ensure Python 3.x and GDB with Python support are installed.
2. Place `break_script.py` in the project directory where GDB will be run.

**How to Run:**

1. Load the script into GDB by running ` gdb -x break_script.py <your_program>  `
2. Adjust paths for input and output files in the script if necessary.
3. Start the GDB session to begin debugging, and the script will manage breakpoints and logging based on input

#### Example

**Input File:**

- **input.json** - This file specifies the functions and the number of times breakpoints should trigger within them. An example content could be:

  ```
  {
    "simulateOperations": {
      "local_vars": ["totalAccounts", "accounts", "i"],
      "times_called": [3, 3, 2],
      "calls": ["createAccount", "deposit", "withdraw"]
    }
  }
  ```

**Config File:**

- **config,json:**

  ```
  {
    "input": "input.json",
    "stdinput": "input.txt",
    "output": "output.json",
    "debug": false,
    "debug_break": false,
    "debug_disasm": false,
    "debugLevel": 0
  }
  ```

**Output File:**

- **output.json** - This file captures the debugging information at each breakpoint as defined by the script. An example of output might be:

  ```
  {
    "breakpoints": [
      {
        "location": "simulateOperations",
        "state": "before call to createAccount",
        "variables": {
          "totalAccounts": 3,
          "i": 0
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```



**Note:** `break_script.py` while only output the variables when the function is called for specific times. In the example provided, it will capture and log variables only when `simulateOperations` calls `createAccount` for the third time.

### README for `visualize_graph.py`

**Description:** `visualize_graph.py` is a Python script that generates an interactive HTML visualization of source code execution. It processes JSON data containing breakpoints and state details alongside source code files, ultimately creating an interactive webpage that allows users to step through code execution and visualize states at breakpoints.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `json`, `os`, `html`

**Input Files:**

- `output.json`: Contains breakpoint data and execution states generated by `break_script.py`
- `source`: Source code file that will be visualized.

**Output Files:**

- `interactive_code.html`: An HTML file that displays the interactive visualization of the source code with breakpoints and state data.

**Setup:**

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Place the `visualize_graph.py`, `output.json`, and `source.c` in the same directory.

**How to Run:**

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the files.
2. Execute the script by running: `python visualize_graph.py`.
3. Open the generated `interactive_code.html` in a web browser to explore the interactive code visualization.
